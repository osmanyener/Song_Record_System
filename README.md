# Song_Record_System
I developed a basic Java Console application that applies Binary Search Tree algorithm.

--> In this project, I created a record system that allows the insertion, search, and deletion of musical records. The initial musical records are read from a text file (songs.txt) where each line holds one song information as follows; <br /> 
Song name;Artist;ID;Genre;Year <br />
--> You can find the related txt file (songs.txt) in the project file. <br />
--> You can see some screenshots of the project below. <br />

--> example run <br />
